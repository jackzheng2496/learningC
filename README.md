This will track my progress in learning the C language. 

-7/28/2016 Update from the dead, 75% of the way through the pointers chapter. Using pointers will definitely take some time. Especially with multiple indirections, it can be a little tricky to do address arithmetic and to not get segfaults. 

-12/09/2016 Just 'finished' my Systems Programming II (CSE 320) class with only a final left to go. Hopefully I can TA for the class and learn more about C.
