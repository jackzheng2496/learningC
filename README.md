This will track my progress in learning the C language. 

- Testing another git commit. -3/8/16
- printf() is dangerous, be careful of the types while formatting. -3/8/16
- Arrays are in the format 'type name[]'. There aren't really set boundaries
  so if your array was lets say, int age[] = {1, 2, 3}, you can access
  age[100] and there wouldn't be a compilation error. The number that is 
  outputted varies and this is definitely can be a source of upcoming bugs.  
  -3/9/16
- Forward declarations allow use of functions before defining them. 
  Not too sure how that works because I thought C just read instructions from 
  top to bottom. I am assuming there exist some sort of jump command in place 
  of those predefined functions ?? -3/10/16
