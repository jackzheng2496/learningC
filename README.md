This will track my progress in learning the C language. 

- Testing another git commit. -3/8/16
- printf() is dangerous, be careful of the types while formatting. -3/8/16
- Arrays are in the format 'type name[]'. There aren't really set boundaries
  so if your array was lets say, int age[] = {1, 2, 3}, you can access
  age[100] and there wouldn't be a compilation error. The number that is 
  outputted varies and this is definately can be a source of upcoming bugs.
