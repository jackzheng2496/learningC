This will track my progress in learning the C language. 

-7/28/2016 Update from the dead, 75% of the way through the pointers chapter. Using pointers will definitely take some time. Especially with multiple indirections, it can be a little tricky to do address arithmetic and to not get segfaults. 

-12/09/2016 Just 'finished' my Systems Programming II (CSE 320) class with only a final left to go. Hopefully I can TA for the class and learn more about C.

-12/22/2016 Gonna read Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets over winter... it'll be fun..

-1/11/2017 So... C, as a language, has a bunch of issues. Many of these issues stem from the fact that the language authors wanted to make it easier for C compiler writers. C can act in various ways depending on what architecture you are operating from. Despite all of this, it still remains a useful and powerful language. My best analogy would be comparing C to driving in a rural country. You can do whatever you want as long as you know what you are doing.
  - Arrays are NOT pointers (50% of the time)
  - Automatic type promotion in expressions and function arguments (SOMETIMES, Difference btwn K&R and ANSI)
  - Everything is either completely global to all files or 'static' to one file, there is no in between
  - int * const ptr and int const * ptr are not the same
  - buffer overflows
